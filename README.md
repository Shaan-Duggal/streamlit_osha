## Introducing the Construction Safety Assistant

Our new web application, which is powered by Streamlit, machine learning, and artificial intelligence is here to help keep construction sites safer. With the OSHA Workplace Safety Analysis, anyone from construction managers to safety officers to employees can upload photos of their sites. The web application uses a large language model (LLM) to check these photos against OSHA guidelines and highlights any safety red flags.

### The Need for Safety

Construction sites are busy and risky places. Accidents will happen, and they may be serious. While regular checks are crucial, they can also be a lot of work and sometimes mistakes are not found. Since construction sites are always changing, it's important to keep safety checks up to date. 

### The Old Way

Usually, safety inspections are done the old way, with safety officers walking around, and checking things out. It works, but it's slow and depends a lot on the person doing the checking. Everyone has off days, and some things might get overlooked.

### Our Smarter Approach

Our web application, the Construction Safety Assistant, uses a new approach. Here’s how it makes things better:

- **Faster Feedback:** Get safety feedback instantly, no waiting around.
- **Always Accurate:** Our tech checks everything the same way every time, so nothing gets missed.
- **Super Simple to Use:** Whether you’re on a tablet or a phone, our web application works wherever you are, right at the construction site.
- **Helpful Reports:** Not only does it point out problems, but it also helps you keep track of reports that are easy to use for training and compliance.

### What Our Web Application Does

- **Easy Uploads:** Snap a photo, upload it directly through the web application, and you're set.
- **Smart Scans:** The web application scans your photos against comprehensive OSHA guidelines and points out any issues.
