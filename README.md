# Construction Analyzer

The Construction Analyzer app leverages the power of Streamlit and advanced machine learning to enhance workplace safety at construction sites. Users can upload images of construction sites, and the app employs a large language model (LLM) to analyze and compare these images against OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) guidelines. The app highlights potential safety concerns, providing an invaluable tool for construction managers and safety officers.

## Problem

Construction sites are inherently risky, with numerous potential hazards that can lead to injuries or fatalities. Regular safety inspections are crucial but can be time-consuming and subject to human error. The complexity and dynamic nature of construction sites often require frequent reassessment to maintain safety standards.

## Current Solutions

Traditional methods involve manual inspections and audits conducted by safety officers. While effective, these inspections are slow and labor-intensive. Additionally, they rely heavily on the expertise and attention to detail of the inspector, which can vary significantly.

## Our Solution

The Construction Analyzer app transforms this process by using machine learning to automate the visual inspection of construction sites. By uploading site images to our app, users can quickly identify areas that may not comply with OSHA standards. Hereâ€™s how our app stands out:

- **Speed**: The app provides immediate feedback, significantly faster than manual inspections.
- **Consistency**: Machine learning models ensure that every image is analyzed with consistent criteria.
- **Accessibility**: Easy to use from any device with an internet connection, making it ideal for on-site checks.
- **Documentation**: Generates reports that can be used for compliance and training purposes.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Securely upload images of your construction site directly through the app.
- **Automated Analysis**: The app uses a state-of-the-art LLM to analyze uploaded images against a comprehensive list of OSHA guidelines.
- **Highlighting Concerns**: Areas of potential safety violations are highlighted on the images, providing visual cues for easier understanding.
- **Report Generation**: Generate detailed reports outlining identified issues, complete with images and suggestions for remediation.
